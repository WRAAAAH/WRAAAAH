## Me
I'm a 4th-year technical student passionate about IT and constantly learning new things. I'm expanding my skills in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and network automation while co-founding a learning platform aimed at transforming IT education. Who knows‚Äîmaybe I'll even earn some money along the way! üòâ

## Learning Platform Project üåü
I'm co-founding a web-based learning platform designed to deliver interactive courses, hands-on labs, and a vibrant community for tech enthusiasts. Stay tuned for updates as we work to revolutionize IT education! üöÄ
